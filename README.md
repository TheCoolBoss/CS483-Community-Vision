Introduction - 

Since 1989, Community Vision has been a nonprofit supporting people with disabilities. Historically, people with disabilities were institutionalized and viewed as mentally feeble. Community Vision's mission "is to make Oregon a place where people with disabilities can live, work, and thrive in the communities of their choice." 
Within Community Vision is the Assistive Technologies lab. Assistive Technologies include any product, customization, or support to help someone with a disability meet a functional need. Examples include text-to-speech aid, wheelchairs, or utensils with built up handles. Our capstone project will focus on an assistive technology in the form of a morse code learning website. The website targets young children with physical disabilities, ranging from toddlers to 8-year-olds. Morse code has been a liberating tool enabling disabled people to learn and communicate. Since it is difficult for people with physical disabilities to use their hands or type, the alphabet may seem inaccessible. A switch interface with dot and dash combinations for morse code can serve as a tool to overcome these challenges.  

This requirements document will discuss the outline for our capstone project. It will provide a Product Overview, list the Functional and Non-functional Requirements, show the User Interface, outline the Preliminary Sprint Schedule for the project, explain High-Level Technical Specifications, Budget, Facilities, and Ethical Considerations. 

Product Overview -  

The user will go to playmorse.com and select a game or activity. They will interact with the website by inputting a series of ‘spaces’ and ‘enters’ into their keyboard or switch interface. This data will be sent from the keyboard/switch to the website, which will interpret the space as a dot and enter as a dash.  
The website will display the user’s input and play a tone that corresponds with the dot or dash. It will then display whether the input was correct. 
The user will listen to the audio and display from the website and either continue to the next problem or retype the input if it was incorrect. 
 

Functional Requirements -  

As a learner I need to hear different tones when I press space or enter so that I can distinguish between the dot and the dash more clearly. (4 hours) 

As a helper, I need to be able to adjust the color of the website and its text size so that my learner can see the game. (2 hours) 

As a learner, I need to have high contrast between different elements on the website so that I can easily see the game. (2 hours) 

As a helper I need to be able to adjust the speed of the game so that my learner can take as much time as they need to press space or enter. (2 hours) 

As a user or helper, I need to be able to access the instructions on how to use the website so that I can know which buttons to press (2 hours) 

As a user, I need to have games that increase in difficulty so that I am challenged and constantly learning. (50 hours) 

As a helper or user, I need the website to be intuitive so that I have an easy time learning. (20 hours) 

As a helper or user, I need the option for background music so that my learning is more relaxing. (30 hours) 

As a user, I need the website to be attractive and fun so that I am excited to learn. (30 hours)  

 
Non-Functional Requirements -  

Average response time to user commands when playing games on website should be between 5 seconds and 15 seconds (aside from user’s internet speeds). 

The speed of the game on the website should be adjusted on a scale from 0.5 to 5, to help learners who have different speeds when playing games. 

The games should have difficulty levels from level 1 to level 4. 

The colors on the website should be able to be adjusted from 0 to max brightness. The text size should also be in a range of 8 to 72 to help learners adjust the text sizes to help visually impaired students. 

The website will have 5 to 10 relaxing songs for background music for learners who learn while listening to music. 

The website will have some sort of animation, jiggle or bubble elements added to make the website more attractive. 

Dot and dash sounds 

Currently, the auditory cues of the dot and dash sounds on the website are not easily distinguishable. Our team will differentiate between the two with different frequencies and lengths. The dot sound will be high pitched and short while the dash sound will be low pitched and longer.  

Game speed must be variable 

Students with physical disabilities such as cerebral palsy struggle with Weakness and High Tone meaning resting muscle tension is very tight. This makes it difficult to move arms back and forth quickly. Currently, the length of time between space and enter activations to be considered a part of the same pattern is 4 seconds. We plan to increase this to 5 seconds.  

More visual contrast 

Visual contrast on our website is very important for visually impaired students. We plan to add a “contrasting text outline” option in settings that will further increase contrast.  

We also plan to alter the visual contrast of the current website, to make the website more beautiful. We are comparing designs with well-revered learning websites such as SoloLearn or Khan Academy.  

Make settings page more visually pleasing 

The current settings page is a bit cluttered and confusing. We plan to re-design the layout and options of the settings page. 

New game 

There is not currently a learning game that allows letter customization. This new game will deal with letter learning that is motivating and fun. Allowing a student to select a handful of letters that are meaningful to them (such as S if the student’s name is Stella or such as T if the student loves Trains) can increase enjoyment in game play.  

Fine tune current games 

We plan to go through the current learning games on the website to find bugs and strange behavior. We will fine tune the games, making for a better game experience.  

Background music 

Ability to “unlock” higher levels as lower levels are completed 

Movement animations associated with some letters or words 

For example, jiggle as a visual cue if wrong  


High-level Technical Specifications -  

Currently the website is hosted by our community partner. However, in the development phase we will use GitHub to create new features and test on our local machines. From there we will be able to deliver updates to the Lab. Our website will be developed using HTML, CSS, and ReactJS in the same way that it was last year. It is currently designed for use on desktop computers; however, we will attempt to make the page displayable on mobile devices. Although mobile devices are not the primary target, our community partner would like it to at least function on phones. At the end of the term, we will submit our code files to our community partner in a ZIP file via email.  


Budget -  

Estimated costs associated with our project: 
Switch interface: We Will ask Kim which model they have so we can buy the exact same. Market research indicates approximately $100.  

Facilities-  

Since our project would expand functionality and investigate user experience of a website application that had been built by a previous team, playmorse.com. Everything we will need, including the code and access to a server will be provided by our client. 

Ethical Considerations -  

Since our project is web based, there are not many ethical considerations in terms of user confidentiality and environmental impact. Using websitecarbon.com, we found that only .31g of CO2 is produced every time someone visits our web page (playmorse.com). This means our website currently emits the amount of carbon that two trees absorb in a year. While this is not a lot, it is still something to keep in mind for the future when we have more traffic to the website. Privacy and confidentiality are not concerns, as we do not have a database, so we do not store any user information.  

Our website has many benefits to the individuals who use it, and to society. Assistive technology in general provides an easier way for people with disabilities to learn and communicate. It is beneficial to society and community to utilize these new forms of communication to allow more connection and representation of all people. The website works best when children start at an early age, since our brains learn quicker when we are younger. In 2020, Eman Al-Zboon et al studied the use of assistive technology in the elementary school classroom. They concluded that assistive technologies should be used more frequently at an early age. They recommended that “teachers should be always motivated and encouraged to employ assistive technologies in teaching students with disabilities” (Al-Zboon, 2020). This is consistent with our belief that assistive technology like our website should be used more frequently and by more people for the greatest benefit.  

 

Conclusion –  

To recapitulate, this document is an outline for our capstone’s morse code learning website in collaboration with Community Vision’s Assistive Technology Lab. The previous pages serve as speculations, UI design, requirements, proposed Sprint schedule, and potential issues and risk associated with the project. Students with physical disabilities will benefit from this website as it will enhance their learning at a young age which can provide them literacy later in life.

Other Considerations -  

PlayMorse is a website designed for students with disabilities; however, everyone working on it as far as we know is a person without disabilities. We must make sure to keep the focus on helping people who are not exactly like us, rather than focusing on our own desires or wants.
