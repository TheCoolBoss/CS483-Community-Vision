      <h1>About Community Vision</h1>
      <p>Community Vision takes a person-centered approach in providing quality 
        supports tailored to the unique needs and wishes of each individual and family.</p>
        
      <p1>We work with natural support systems including an individualâ€™s family, friends,
        and local community to build a network that provides the means for an individual 
        to be a valued and contributing member of their community.</p1>
        
      <p2>Our work is rooted in the belief that all people, regardless of perceived ability, 
        deserve the freedom to make the basic choices that define their lives. We offer a 
        variety of services to provide the tools for people to live as independently as
        possible, while pursuing their goals and dreams. These services include: supported
        living, employment services, financial education and savings plans, affordable housing
        resources, family support, and assistive technology consultations and training.</p2>
